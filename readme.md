## about

I currently use this website as my blog and general project output. It currently resides on WordPress, but not for long. This repo is an attempt to change that to a more python centric platform and use a modern deployment process.

## current plans

* Use [Mezzanine](mezzanine.jupo.org) as the platform.
* Use [Dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku) for deployments to a VPS.
* Plan out kickass IA with simplicity and cleanliness for design
